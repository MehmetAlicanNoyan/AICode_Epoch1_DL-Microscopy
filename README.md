# FruitPunch AI Code epoch 1: Deep Learning Microscopy

AI Code is an initiative by fruitpunch where students can learn to apply AI together by solving a challenge under supervision of an expert. This repository contains the challenge files for epoch 1.

## Challenge description
This week we will continue with an applied challenge. Imagine you can obtain high resolution images using a cheap microscope! This is possible thanks to deep learning. Your task this week will be to build a neural network to tackle this challenge. The challenge is based on [this paper](https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-4-11-1437).

**The goal:** Build a neural network that takes 14x14 MNIST images and spits them out in higher resolution (28x28). 
- x_train_lowres contains 60000 low resolution (14x14) images 
- x_train contains 60000 high resolution (28x28) counterparts.
